    "As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a ranged attack with a melee weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. Your magic accelerates your weapon to uncannny speeds over the course of its trajectory. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects. If this attack is at long range it isn't at disadvantage and deals additional piercing damage equal to your spellcasting modifier.",
    "Alternatively, you can cast this cantrip on a weapon that doesn't have the thrown property. It gains a thrown range of 20/60 until the end of your next turn and floats in the air close at hand, vibrating softly.",
    "This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the attack deals an extra {@dice 1d8} piercing damage to the target, and the damage of the spell if the the target is at long range increases to {@dice 1d8} + your spellcasting modifier. Both damage rolls increase by {@dice 1d8} at 11th level and 17th level."
